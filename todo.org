* TODO PoC: Real-Time AI Assistant for GM
In this one-week Proof of Concept, we’ll focus on the bare minimum for capturing voice input, generating AI suggestions, and displaying them in real time.

** TODO Phase 1: Minimal Infrastructure & Project Setup
*** TODO Create Local Dev Environment
    - [X] Initialize a new repository (GitHub or local)
    - [X] Configure a simple Node.js + Express backend
    - [X] Set up basic frontend framework (React or Next.js)
*** TODO Install Dependencies
    - [ ] Add `openai` or `azure/openai` client library
    - [ ] Add `socket.io` (or similar) for WebSockets
    - [ ] Add `dotenv` for environment variables

** TODO Phase 2: Speech-to-Text & AI Integration
*** TODO Implement Local Speech-to-Text
    - [ ] Use Browser’s Web Speech API to capture live audio
    - [ ] Transcribe GM’s speech to text in real time
    - [ ] Send final transcripts to backend via REST or WebSockets
*** TODO Connect to Azure OpenAI (GPT)
    - [ ] Set up an Azure OpenAI resource (or use OpenAI API key)
    - [ ] Write minimal prompt logic: “Given the GM said X, respond with a suggestion.”
    - [ ] Return AI suggestion to backend

** TODO Phase 3: Real-Time Updates to Frontend
*** TODO Implement WebSockets on Backend
    - [ ] Set up `/socket.io` or similar endpoint
    - [ ] On receiving AI response, emit event with suggestion text
*** TODO Display AI Suggestions in Frontend
    - [ ] Connect React/Next.js to WebSocket endpoint
    - [ ] Listen for `ai_response` events
    - [ ] Render suggestions in a simple list or box

** TODO Phase 4: Test & Validate
*** TODO Local Testing
    - [ ] Run backend on `localhost:5000`, frontend on `localhost:3000`
    - [ ] Confirm real-time flow: Speak → Transcription → AI → Suggestion
    - [ ] Verify suggestions appear without manual refresh
*** TODO Basic Performance Check
    - [ ] Ensure quick turnaround from speech to AI response
    - [ ] Log latencies (time from speech end to suggestion received)

** TODO Phase 5: Wrap-Up & Demo
*** TODO Create Readme / Demo Video
    - [ ] Add clear setup instructions in README
    - [ ] Record a brief video or GIF demonstrating real-time suggestions
*** TODO Gather Feedback
    - [ ] Note any issues with speech accuracy or AI prompts
    - [ ] Plan next steps (session memory, deeper context, etc.)
