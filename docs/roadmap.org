* Technical Roadmap for scrying.ai: a real time tabletop roleplaying game assistant.
** DONE PoC: Real-Time AI Assistant
*** DONE Minimal Infrastructure & Project Setup
- [X] Initialize a new repository (GitHub or local)
- [X] Configure a simple Node.js + Express backend
- [X] Set up basic frontend framework (Vite)

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations
- **PoC Scope vs. Long-Term Architecture** Decide how much of the PoC
  code will be disposable vs. production-ready to avoid technical
  debt.
- **Scalability** Even in a PoC, keep an eye on how easily you can
  scale once you move beyond minimal infrastructure.

** DONE Speech-to-Text & AI Integration
- [X] Use Browser’s Web Speech API for live audio capture
- [X] Send transcripts to backend via WebSockets
- [X] Connect to Azure OpenAI for real-time suggestions

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations
- **AI API Integration** Balance the latency and cost of
  external AI calls vs. potential on-prem or cheaper
  alternatives.
- **Latency & Bandwidth** WebSockets can be sensitive to
  network conditions; ensure fallback mechanisms (e.g., SSE or
  polling).
- **Browser Compatibility** Web Speech API support may vary;
  confirm the user agent coverage meets your needs.

** DONE Real-Time Frontend Updates
- [X] Implement WebSocket on backend
- [X] Render AI suggestions in frontend UI

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations for later
- **Connection Limits** WebSockets keep connections open. Plan
  for concurrency limits or load-balancing strategies.
- **Security & Authentication** Ensure WebSocket connections
  are TLS-encrypted (wss://) and properly authenticated.

** DONE Preliminary Tasks & Project Setup
*** DONE Rename repository from "CotoGM-POC" to "scryingAI"
   - [X] Update remote repository name
   - [X] Update README.md to reflect long-term project goals
   - [X] Document initial MVP functionality

*** DONE Establish Project Folder Structure
   - [X] Create /react-client as basic PoC client
   - [X] Create /client-react-native for React Native frontend (web
     and mobile)
   - [X] Create /api for Node.js backend
   - [X] Create /infrastructure/terraform for Terraform code
   - [X] Create /infrastructure/helm for Kubernetes Helm charts
   - [X] Create /k8s for Kubernetes manifests
   - [X] Create /discord-bot for Discord integration
   - [X] Create /scripts for utility scripts
   - [X] Create .github/workflows for GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
   - [X] Create /docs for architectural decisions

*** Repository Org Setup
- [ ] Create **GitHub organization**: Scrying AI Lab or Scrying AI Team
- [ ] Create **monorepo**: `scrying-ai/mono`
- [ ] Set up **repo permissions** to allow contributors to create PRs without forking

*** Branching Strategy
- [ ] Research and decide on a **branching model** (e.g., `main` + feature branches, GitFlow, trunk-based)
- [ ] Configure **branch protection rules** (e.g., require PR reviews, prevent direct pushes to `main`)
- [ ] Decide on **release management** (e.g., tags, versioning strategy)

*** Monorepo Management
- [ ] Research **monorepo strategies** (e.g., Google-style monorepo, multi-package, service-oriented)
- [ ] Evaluate **monorepo tooling**:
  - [ ] **Nx** (TypeScript/JS-focused)
  - [ ] **Turborepo** (lightweight, JS-focused)
  - [ ] **Bazel** (Google-scale, all languages)

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations
**** Monorepo vs. Multi-Repo
   - Decide if everything stays in a single repo (simpler
     cross-service changes) or multiple repos (more isolation).
**** Infrastructure as Code
   - Ensure the folder structure supports Terraform, Helm, and future
     expansions.
**** Collaboration & Governance
   - Enforce code owners, PR checks, and adopt a branching model
     (GitFlow or trunk-based).
**** Documentation & Testing
   - Maintain an Architecture Decisions Record (ADR) log in /docs.
   - Plan early for cross-platform testing (mobile, web, iOS) to
     ensure consistent UI/UX and parity.

     environment or function; zero-trust approaches.
   - **Security Posture** Combine Azure Firewall, NSGs, Bastion, and
     private endpoints.
   - **Performance Overhead** Ensure hub-and-spoke or firewall routing
     does not break real-time performance.
   - **Certificates & Encryption** Confirm DNS or HTTP challenges for
     Let’s Encrypt are feasible; automate renewals.

         a service mesh or custom certificates)

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations
       - **Service Boundaries** Clearly define each microservice’s
         responsibility to avoid domain overlap.
       - **Message-Driven vs. Synchronous** Real-time suggestions
         might need sync calls, while summarization can be
         event-driven.
       - **Data Consistency** Consider an event-sourcing or CQRS
         approach for storing game states and AI suggestions.
       - **WebSocket Encryption** Confirm internal services or
         user-facing gateways secure data in transit (wss://).
       - **Scalability & Resource Usage** AI microservices might need
         GPU nodes or advanced scaling profiles in AKS.

*** TODO Discord Bot Integration
       - [ ] Develop Discord bot for AI suggestions in real-time
       - [ ] Ensure secure WebSocket communication between bot and
         backend
       - [ ] Deploy bot with restricted permissions for specific
         channels

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations
       - **Cross-Platform Code Sharing** Weigh React Native Web vs. a
         dedicated ReactJS codebase for the browser experience.
       - **Auth & Token Flows** Ensure secure token handling in mobile
         contexts—storage, refresh flows, logout flows.
       - **Discord Rate Limits** Implement backoff to avoid API bans
         if the bot sends too many messages too quickly.
       - **Testing Strategy**
         - **Cross-platform**: Ensure CI environment can build & test
           iOS, Android, and web.

         pod failures
       - [ ] Build advanced analytics dashboards (user flows,
         cross-platform usage, session data)

*** TODO Security Best Practices
       - [ ] Harden AKS clusters with Pod Security Policies (PSPs) or
         Pod Security Standards
       - [ ] Secure all private endpoints (Key Vault, Redis,
         PostgreSQL, etc.)
       - [ ] Enable Azure Defender for Kubernetes
       - [ ] Ensure logs are securely stored in Azure Monitor or an
         external SIEM
       - [ ] Validate WebSocket encryption end-to-end (TLS termination
         vs. pass-through)

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations
       - **Centralized Logging & Analytics** Evaluate EFK (Elastic,
         Fluent, Kibana), Splunk, or native Azure Monitor for log
         correlation.
       - **Distributed Tracing** Implement OpenTelemetry/Jaeger to
         trace requests across microservices and AI pipelines.

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations
       - **Load Testing & Benchmarking** Ensure AI calls remain within
         acceptable latency under peak loads.
       - **Rollback & Release Strategies** Blue-green or canary
         deployments with a tested rollback plan is essential for
         business continuity.
       - **DNS & Traffic Management** Cloudflare or Azure Front Door
         can offer caching, SSL termination, and DDoS protection at
         scale.

       - [ ] Integrate Azure Application Insights for user behavior
         tracking
       - [ ] Implement personalized AI suggestions based on user
         history

*** System Design Requirements & Considerations
       - **DR Drills** Regularly test multi-region failover to ensure
         staff can execute DR plans swiftly.
       - **Serverless vs. AKS** Some batch jobs or AI tasks might
         benefit from serverless if usage is spiky.
       - **Chaos Engineering** Testing node failures, network
         latencies, or partial outages can uncover resilience gaps.
       - **Accessibility & Compliance** Evaluate WCAG (web content
         accessibility guidelines) for the React Native web experience
         if needed.
