# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At this stage, our project is in **pre-development** and no official versions have been released yet. Therefore, **no versions are currently supported** for security updates.

We will update this section once we have a stable release schedule and defined versions to maintain.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We welcome any vulnerability reports even during the pre-development phase. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Contact Us**  
   - Send an email to [security@yourorg.com](mailto:admin@scrying.ai) with the subject line **“Security Issue: [Project Name]”**.
   - Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue, along with any relevant code snippets or logs.

2. **Acknowledgment & Triage**  
   - You can expect a response within **72 hours** (3 business days).
   - The team will evaluate the reported vulnerability and begin investigating.

3. **Fix & Release**  
   - Because our project is still under active development, we will integrate security fixes as soon as possible.
   - When we create an official release, we will incorporate any necessary patches.

4. **Disclosure**  
   - Once a fix is implemented or a workaround is available, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability and resolution.
   - You will receive credit for your report if you want to be acknowledged.

**Thank you for helping us ensure the security of this project—even before it’s officially released!**
