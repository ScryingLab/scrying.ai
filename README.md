# Scrying.ai

Scrying.ai is an AI assistant designed to aid tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) such as the popular *Dungeons & Dragons* franchise by providing real-time AI suggestions and post-session summaries.

## Project Philosophy  

This open-source project was created as a reaction to the turbulent conditions of the market and is an adaptation to the oncoming wave of AI products. It is a space for people with diverse skill sets to come together and build something fun and useful, but most importantly, to collaborate and learn modern technology.  

Our goal is to model and teach **modern web development, DevOps practices, and AI integration** while working on a project that can serve as a **portfolio piece** for an independent contributor's career progression.  

Whether you're new to development or an industry expert, we want to help you **gain experience, build confidence, and develop real-world stories** that can be used in job interviews and beyond.

Consider giving our small team a ⭐ if you resonate with the project!
