# Scrying.ai

Scrying.ai is an AI assistant designed to enhance tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) such as the popular *Dungeons & Dragons* franchise by providing real-time AI suggestions and post-session summaries.

## Project Philosophy  

This open-source project was created as a reaction to the turbulent conditions of the market and is an adaption to the oncoming wave of AI products. It is to provide a space for people with diverse skill sets to come together and build something fun and useful, but most importantly, to collaborate and learn modern technology.  

Our goal is to teach modern web development, DevOps practices, and AI integration while working on an open-source project that can serve as a portfolio piece.  
Whether you're new to development or an industry expert, we want to help you gain experience, build confidence, and develop real-world stories that can be used in job interviews and beyond.  

## Join the Project  

We are in a pre-development phase and looking for contributors to start helping today.  

We welcome any level of experience and will actively guide you in contributing as soon as possible. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, there's a place for you here.  

## The Project at a Glance  

### AI-Integrated Web App Frontend  
- Cross-platform support (browser, mobile, Discord plugin)  
- AI-managed UI to dynamically adjust to the game master's needs  
- AI response display UI with in-game contextual highlights  
- Search engine optimized for discoverability  
- SSO integration for persistent user sessions and multi-device support  
- Potential billing integration for handling AI costs and premium features  

### Modern DevOps Pipeline and Infrastructure  
- Private Azure cloud infrastructure with secure networking  
- CI/CD pipelines with ephemeral environments for seamless development  
- Scalable & safe deployment strategies, including blue-green and canary deployments  
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated, repeatable infrastructure provisioning  
- Observability & monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry  
- Automated scaling and cost optimization strategies  

### Machine Learning and Data Problems  
- Transcribe and identify player voices to track dialogue and scene changes  
- AI-assisted post-game data processing for summaries:  
  - Session recap with major plot points  
  - "When we last left our heroes" introduction  
  - Player and character insights  
  - Customizable session tags for easier review  
- Real-time AI suggestions with contextual awareness:  
  - Narrative hints (what happens next)  
  - On-demand rule clarifications  
  - Random tables (items, monsters, events)  
  - AI-generated scene descriptions  
  - UI management via a domain-specific language (determining what's most relevant to show the game master at any moment)  
- Player behavior tracking and recommendation systems for enhancing session flow  

### Internal Tooling – Using AI to Solve Internal Problems Too  
- GitHub issue tracking with AI-powered summarization and prioritization  
- Discord bots for tracking internal conversations and improving feature discoverability  
- Automated documentation generation  
- AI-assisted PR review suggestions for contributors  
- More to come…
